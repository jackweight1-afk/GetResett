🟢 RESET 1 — “Bring It Back In”
A gentle reset that narrows your attention from the whole room to one steady point, helping your brain settle and focus.
Step 1 — Settle In
Hold your phone comfortably.
Rest your shoulders.
We’re going to bring your attention from “everywhere” back to one place.
Tap Continue.
Step 2 — Take In the Whole Screen
Look at the entire screen at once.
Notice the colours, the edges, the light around it.
Let your breathing stay natural.
Tap Continue.
Step 3 — Half the Screen
Now look only at the top half of your screen.
Fewer things to take in.
A touch quieter already.
Tap Continue.
Step 4 — A Smaller Area
Choose a space about the size of a coaster on the screen.
Let your eyes rest there for one slow breath in… and a longer one out.
Let everything else soften in the background.
Tap Continue.
Step 5 — One Small Point
Pick a tiny detail — a letter, a corner, an icon.
Keep a soft, steady gaze on it.
Jaw loose. Shoulders easy.
Tap Continue.
Step 6 — Hold This Spot
Say quietly in your head: “Just here.”
Breathe once more.
Let the rest of the world fall to the edges.
Tap Continue.
Step 7 — See Your Next Move
Picture the first small action you’ll take after this.
Maybe a tap, a message, or opening a tab.
See yourself doing it smoothly.
Tap Continue.
Step 8 — Finish
You’ve brought your attention back in.
One steady point, one clear mind.
Reset complete.
🟢 RESET 2 — “Steady Hands, Steady Mind”
A calming hand-sequence that brings the brain back into a steady rhythm and reduces scattered energy.
Step 1 — Start
Rest your elbows or forearms lightly on your thighs or desk.
We’ll use a simple hand pattern to steady your attention.
Tap Continue.
Step 2 — Left Hand Only
Tap your thumb to each finger on your left hand:
Index → middle → ring → little…
Then back again, little → ring → middle → index.
Slow and smooth.
Tap Continue.
Step 3 — Right Hand Only
Same pattern with your right hand.
Keep it gentle. No rush.
Let your breath stay easy.
Tap Continue.
Step 4 — One Side Then the Other
Left hand does one full run.
Then the right hand does one full run.
Repeat this swap twice.
Shoulders relaxed.
Tap Continue.
Step 5 — Both Hands Together
Now do the pattern with both hands at the same time.
Thumb to index… middle… ring… little… and back.
Move slowly and evenly.
Tap Continue.
Step 6 — Slow the Pace
Repeat the pattern once more, just a little slower.
Feel the mind follow the steadier rhythm.
Tap Continue.
Step 7 — Hands Rest
Place your hands down.
Notice the quiet feeling in your head now the movement has stopped.
Hold one long out-breath.
Tap Continue.
Step 8 — Finish
Rhythm restored.
Mind calmer and more settled.
Reset complete.
Ease or skip any movement that isn’t comfortable for you.
🟢 RESET 3 — “Follow the Grid”
A simple eyes-only drill that steadies attention and helps reduce the jumpy, scattered feeling.
Step 1 — Picture the Grid
Imagine a 3×3 grid on your screen — like a noughts-and-crosses board.
Keep your head still and move only your eyes.
Tap Continue.
Step 2 — Across the Rows
With your eyes, trace the top row from left to right.
Then the middle row.
Then the bottom row.
Smooth and steady.
Tap Continue.
Step 3 — Down the Columns
Trace the first column from top to bottom.
Then the middle column.
Then the last one.
Keep your breathing soft.
Tap Continue.
Step 4 — Corners
Touch your gaze to each corner of the grid in a clockwise loop:
Top-left → top-right → bottom-right → bottom-left.
Tap Continue.
Step 5 — Centre Point
Rest your gaze on the centre square.
Hold it there for one slow breath.
Let the rest soften.
Tap Continue.
Step 6 — Short Pattern
Follow this quick sequence with your eyes:
Top-middle → centre → bottom-middle → centre.
Do this twice without rushing.
Tap Continue.
Step 7 — Return to Centre
Bring your gaze back to the centre square.
Hold there through a longer out-breath.
Notice the focus settling.
Tap Continue.
Step 8 — Finish
Your attention is steadier.
The noise has dropped.
Reset complete.
🟢 RESET 4 — “One Thing at a Time”
A grounding reset that cuts through mental clutter by guiding attention through senses one by one.
Step 1 — Start
When the mind feels scattered, it’s often because too much is happening at once.
We’ll slow it down by focusing on one sense at a time.
Tap Continue.
Step 2 — Look
Choose one small spot on the screen.
Notice its shape, brightness and edges.
Stay here for a moment.
Tap Continue.
Step 3 — Feel
Shift your attention to your hands.
Feel the phone’s weight and the warmth where you’re holding it.
Soften your grip slightly.
Tap Continue.
Step 4 — Listen
Now pay attention to sound.
Pick one far sound, then one closer sound (even your breath).
Let anything else fade into the background.
Tap Continue.
Step 5 — Look Again
Return to the same spot on the screen.
It should feel easier to hold now.
Take one calm breath.
Tap Continue.
Step 6 — Feel Again
Notice the contact in your hands again.
Shoulders soft.
Breathing steady.
Tap Continue.
Step 7 — Choose Your Next Sense
Choose the sense you want to lead your next minute:
Looking, feeling, or listening.
Say it quietly in your head.
Tap Continue.
Step 8 — Finish
You’ve moved from many things to just one.
Carry this steady focus into whatever you do next.
Reset complete.
