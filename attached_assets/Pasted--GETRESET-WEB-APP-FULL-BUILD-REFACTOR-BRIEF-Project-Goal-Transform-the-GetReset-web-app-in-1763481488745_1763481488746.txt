🧩 GETRESET WEB APP – FULL BUILD / REFACTOR BRIEF
🚀 Project Goal

Transform the GetReset web app into a frictionless onboarding and usage experience that mirrors the iOS app, while supporting corporate access codes and maintaining the 3 free resets per day model.

The dashboard, reset experience, and all existing core features should remain unchanged, except where needed to support access logic.

1️⃣ Onboarding Flow (new, replaces existing flow)
Step 1 — Welcome Screen

Title: Welcome to GetReset
Subtitle: Short, guided wellbeing resets for a calmer, more focused mind – in under 2 minutes.

Buttons:

Primary: Get started

Secondary link: Already have an account? Log in

Logic:

If user is already authenticated and hasCompletedOnboarding === true, redirect immediately to /dashboard instead of showing this screen.

Step 2 — Create Account (Sign Up)

Route suggestion: /signup

Fields required:

Name (or First Name)

Email

Password

Checkbox: “I’ve read & agree to the Terms & Privacy Policy.” (links if available)

After successful signup:

Create user in database:

id

name

email

passwordHash (never plain text)

organisationId (nullable)

hasCompletedOnboarding: false

Auto-authenticate user

Redirect to Corporate Code screen

Step 3 — Corporate Code (optional)

Route suggestion: /corporate-code

UI copy:

Title: Do you have a company access code?
Text: If your organisation is partnering with GetReset, you can enter your code to unlock GetReset+ at no cost.

Input: Corporate code
Buttons:

Primary: Confirm & continue

Secondary: Skip for now

Logic:

Validate code on backend.

If valid:

Attach organisationId to user

Proceed to First Reset walkthrough

If invalid:

Show friendly validation error

Allow retry or skipping

Step 4 — First Reset Walkthrough (How to Use GetReset)

Route suggestion: /first-reset or /onboarding/intro

Purpose: Teach the user how resets work before showing dashboard.

Flow example:

Intro message:
Resets help you regulate your mind and body in 1–2 minutes. Let's try your first one now.

Guide user through a simple breathing reset or similar

Completion message:
Great job. You can use resets anytime to feel calmer and more focused.

Button: Go to my dashboard

Logic:

At completion, set hasCompletedOnboarding = true

Redirect to /dashboard

2️⃣ Returning User Behaviour
Log In Flow

Route: /login

After successful login:

If hasCompletedOnboarding === true → go straight to /dashboard

If onboarding incomplete → resume onboarding at the correct step

Stay Logged In / Remember User

Use cookie-based or token-based auth so users can return without re-auth unless session expired.

Log Out

Clear session/token, then redirect to /welcome or /login.

3️⃣ Corporate Code Management in Account Page

Route suggestion: /account or /settings

Users must be able to:

View name and email

Add/update corporate code

Save changes

Log out

Corporate code validation same as onboarding logic.

4️⃣ GetReset+ Access Logic Requirements (CRITICAL)

These rules must remain exactly as written:

IMPORTANT FEATURE RULES (DO NOT CHANGE):

1. Users without corporate access may use 3 free resets per day.
2. After 3 resets, show the GetReset+ upgrade/paywall screen.
3. If a user enters a valid corporate code, they instantly unlock GetReset+ at no cost.
4. Users with corporate access have unlimited resets.
5. If a corporate code is removed/invalidated, revert user back to free tier limits.
6. All dashboard + reset UI must remain unchanged except for access logic.
7. Returning users with completed onboarding skip onboarding entirely.

5️⃣ Upgrade Prompt Requirements

If user reaches reset limit and does not have GetReset+:

Display:

Message that GetReset+ unlocks unlimited wellbeing resets

Button: Upgrade to GetReset+

Link: Enter corporate code
text: Does your company already use GetReset? Enter your access code

No feature restrictions for corporate users.

6️⃣ Backend Requirements

User Model:

id
name
email
passwordHash
organisationId (nullable)
hasCompletedOnboarding (boolean)


Organisation Model:

id
name
corporateCode (unique)


Required API endpoints (names can vary):

POST /auth/register
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/logout
GET  /auth/me
POST /user/corporate-code  (attach/validate code)

7️⃣ Definition of Done

Implementation is complete when:

✔ New user can complete full onboarding and land on dashboard
✔ Returning user logs in and skips onboarding
✔ Daily reset limit AND GetReset+ paywall works correctly
✔ Valid corporate code unlocks unlimited resets
✔ Corporate code can be added later via account settings
✔ User can log out and back in without repeated onboarding
✔ Existing dashboard and reset functionality remain intact
