🟣 RESET 1 — Full-Body Tense & Release (PMR, expanded)

Duration: ~90–110 s
Science: Brief cycles of tense→release lower muscle tone and nudge the nervous system toward parasympathetic calm.

STEP 1 — Introduction
Title: Tense & Release
Text: We’ll quickly ease the tension from your body. Keep your eyes on the screen and follow each short cue.

STEP 2 — Hands
Title: Hands
Text: Clench both fists. Hold 3… 2… 1… Release. Let your fingers hang loose.

STEP 3 — Shoulders
Title: Shoulders
Text: Lift your shoulders a little towards your ears. Hold 3… 2… 1… Drop them. Notice the weight fall away.

STEP 4 — Jaw & Face
Title: Jaw
Text: Gently press teeth together for 2 seconds; soften the jaw, lips and brow. Feel the warmth that follows.

STEP 5 — Chest & Stomach
Title: Centre
Text: Tighten your stomach lightly for 3 seconds; release and let the breath move freely again.

STEP 6 — Legs & Feet
Title: Ground
Text: Press feet into the floor for 2 seconds; release and let knees soften. Sense the support beneath you.

STEP 7 — Whole Body Check
Title: Full Body
Text: Tense the whole body just a little — 2 seconds — and let everything go at once. Notice the contrast.

STEP 8 — Completion
Title: Reset Complete
Text: Your body is lighter, looser, calmer. Take one easy breath in… and out.

🟣 RESET 2 — Fact–Story Lens (Cognitive Reappraisal, no input)

Duration: ~90–120 s
Science: Labelling what’s observable vs predicted reduces amygdala reactivity and restores perspective.

STEP 1 — Introduction
Title: Fact–Story Lens
Text: When you’re stressed, your mind mixes what’s real with what you fear. We’ll gently separate the two.

STEP 2 — Bring One Stressor to Mind
Title: One Topic
Text: Think of the thing that’s loudest right now. Hold it in mind while you read.

STEP 3 — Name It as a Thought
Title: Create Distance
Text: Say quietly in your head: “I’m noticing a thought about…”. You’re observing it, not being it.

STEP 4 — Spot Two Facts
Title: What’s True Now
Text: Identify up to two things you can actually observe (times, dates, messages, numbers). Facts are steady.

STEP 5 — Spot the Story
Title: What-Ifs & Predictions
Text: Notice what the mind is predicting or assuming. That’s the story. Stories can change.

STEP 6 — Choose a Reframe
Title: Shift the Meaning
Text: Pick one calm line to hold: “It’s temporary.” / “One step at a time.” / “I can ask for help.” Let it settle.

STEP 7 — Small Next Move (Mental)
Title: First Pebble
Text: Picture one tiny action you could take later (a message, a line of a draft, a calendar nudge). Just visualise it clearly.

STEP 8 — Completion
Title: Reset Complete
Text: You’ve pulled fact from fiction. Clarity replaces chaos. Notice the extra space in your chest.

🟣 RESET 3 — Safety Scan (Visual Orientation & Grounding, richer)

Duration: ~80–100 s
Science: Eyes-open orientation and familiar cues signal “no immediate threat”, calming the stress response.

STEP 1 — Introduction
Title: Safety Scan
Text: Stress makes your body act like danger is close. We’ll remind it that you’re safe.

STEP 2 — Left
Title: Left Side
Text: Without moving your head much, let your eyes travel left. Notice colours, shapes and any stillness there.

STEP 3 — Right
Title: Right Side
Text: Now to the right. Take in what’s there without judging. Shoulders soften a fraction.

STEP 4 — Corners
Title: Orient
Text: Let your eyes find the corners of the room or space you’re in. Corners mean structure; structure means safety.

STEP 5 — Familiar Object
Title: Anchor
Text: Choose one ordinary thing nearby — a cup, a chair, the wall. Hold a soft gaze on it.

STEP 6 — Settle
Title: Stay With It
Text: Keep eyes on the object. Take one steady breath in… and a longer breath out. Let your jaw relax.

STEP 7 — Widen
Title: Peripheral View
Text: Keep the object in view while noticing the space around it. Wider vision, wider calm.

STEP 8 — Completion
Title: Reset Complete
Text: Your body has scanned, oriented and settled. Stress response down.

🟣 RESET 4 — Mental Triage (Cognitive Off-Loading, no typing)

Duration: ~90–120 s
Science: Mentally sorting demands into simple containers reduces working-memory load and perceived pressure.

STEP 1 — Introduction
Title: Mental Triage
Text: When stress piles up, your brain tries to hold everything at once. We’ll clear the queue without typing.

STEP 2 — See Three Boxes
Title: Now / Soon / Later
Text: Imagine three calm boxes on the screen: Now, Soon, Later. They’re open and waiting.

STEP 3 — Place One in “Now”
Title: Anchor
Text: Choose one small, meaningful task for today. Picture placing it in Now. The box glows a little brighter.

STEP 4 — Place Two in “Soon”
Title: Park
Text: Pick one or two items that can wait. See them slide into Soon. Your shoulders drop slightly.

STEP 5 — Move the Rest to “Later”
Title: Quiet the Noise
Text: Let the remaining clutter drift into Later. The lid closes with a quiet click.

STEP 6 — Single Focus
Title: Just This
Text: Look again at Now. Imagine the first tiny move you’ll make when you leave this screen. Hold that image for a breath.

STEP 7 — Settle the Body
Title: Down-Shift
Text: Inhale through the nose for 4, exhale through the mouth for 6. Feel the extra room in your mind.

STEP 8 — Completion
Title: Reset Complete
Text: Your load is lighter and your next move is clear.

Implementation notes (for your dev)

Zero input: No fields, no drag-and-drop. All “sorting” happens as guided imagery with visual metaphors (boxes, glow states).

Timing: Aim ~8–12 s per step; allow tap-to-advance so users don’t feel rushed.

Visual aids:

PMR: subtle pulse on target body area icon; soft “release” whoosh.

Fact–Story: two gentle badges (“Fact” / “Story”) that highlight as the user reads the step.

Safety Scan: left/right arrows, corner markers, then a steady “anchor” icon.

Mental Triage: three glowing boxes that subtly brighten/dim as the narrative moves.

Audio (optional): soft ticks at step changes; no voiceover required, but works well if you add it later (en-GB).

Tone: British English; short, grounded lines; no “close your eyes” cues.
