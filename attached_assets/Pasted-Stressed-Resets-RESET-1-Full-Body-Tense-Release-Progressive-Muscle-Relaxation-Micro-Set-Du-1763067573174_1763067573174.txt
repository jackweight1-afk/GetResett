Title: The Stillness Curve
Text:
We’ll use tiny, easy movements and then slow them down to calm your system.
Stand or sit where you feel steady. Hold your phone comfortably.
When you’re ready, tap Continue.

STEP 2 — Side sway
Title: Left to Right
Text:
Start a slow sway from left to right.
Only a few centimetres — nothing big.
Feel the weight move across your feet (or hips if seated).
Keep shoulders soft; face loose.
Tap Continue.

STEP 3 — Front & back
Title: Forward and Return
Text:
Lean a touch forward… then come back to centre.
Small, smooth range — controlled, not wobbly.
Breathe naturally as you move.
Do this gently 8-10 times.
Tap Continue.

STEP 4 — Soft circles
Title: Easy Loops
Text:
Let your upper body draw a slow circle — once clockwise, once anticlockwise.
Keep it tidy and relaxed; head stays easy on top.
If seated, let the movement come from ribs and hips.
Do this 8-10 times
Tap Continue.

STEP 5 — Shrink the circle
Title: Taper the Movement
Text:
Make each circle smaller… smaller…
Sway becomes a tiny shift… then smaller again.
You’re guiding the dial down rather than slamming on the brakes.
Tap Continue.

STEP 6 — Almost still
Title: Neutral Balance
Text:
Find the point where you’re barely moving — balanced but not stiff.
Let your breath flow slowly on its own.
Notice your heart beating 
On the next out-breath, relax your grip on the phone by 5%.
Tap Continue.

STEP 7 — Quick body check
Title: Notice the Quiet
Text:
Mentally scan from the top of your head to the tip of your toes: forehead, jaw, shoulders, chest, stomach, hips, legs, feet.
Where in your body feels quieter than before? Direct your focus there, keep that ease; let the mind rest there.
Take one longer, easy out-breath.
Tap Continue.

STEP 8 — Land it
Title: Settle & Hold
Text:
Stay in that comfortable stillness for a few seconds.
Sinking softly into your stable position, Feet (or seat) holding you firm. 
If a small wobble appears, let it pass — you’re already steady.
Tap Continue.

STEP 9 — Completion
Title: Reset Complete
Text:
Movement has eased into calm.
Notice: posture taller, breathing smoother, mind quieter.
Carry this steadier feeling into your next task.
Reset complete.
Small safety note: ease or skip any movement that isn’t comfortable for you.

🧠 Developer notes (optional)
Animation: gentle oscillating line that narrows step-by-step to a small steady dot by Steps 6–8.
Audio (optional): low “tide” hush at -20 dB; fade slightly as movement reduces.
Tempo: ~15–20 s per tile; allow tap to continue.
UI: Restless orange gradient header; soft haptic tick on step change; no auto-scroll or busy effects.

Tired Resets
🔵 RESET 1 — Posture Ladder (gently waking the body)
Duration: ~90–120 s • Why it helps: A little height + chest opening improves breathing mechanics and alertness.
Step 1 — Settle in
Hold your phone with a light grip.
Place both feet flat, hip-width apart.
We’ll lift posture a notch at a time so energy rises without strain.
Tap Continue.
Step 2 — Find an easy height
Imagine a tiny thread lifting the crown of your head.
Grow one centimetre taller; keep ribs soft, bum relaxed.
Notice the extra space for air under your collarbones.
Tap Continue.
Step 3 — Roll some space open
Roll both shoulders up… back… down.
Pause. Repeat once, a touch slower.
Feel the shoulder blades settle lower; chest widens naturally.
Tap Continue.
Step 4 — Line up the head
Glide your chin gently back (not down) so ears stack over shoulders.
Unclench the jaw; let the tongue rest on the roof of your mouth.
Breathing often clears here — Take a note of this, breathe deeply and slowly
Tap Continue.
Step 5 — Let the ribs breathe
Inhale and exaggerate the rib movement, feel yourself widen like an umbrella.
As you exhale, push the air out of your chest, whilst keeping the form you’ve built in the inhale
You’ve made space and found a position of calm and confidence
Sit in this pose for a second, feel how your body feels powerful and alert
Tap Continue.
Step 6 — Sweep and reset
Sweep your forearms forward and down, as if clearing the air in front of you
Let the shoulder blades glide down your back; elongate the neck upwards, stretching it out. 
Don’t tense your face muscles, let them stay easy
Tap Continue.
Step 7 — Anchor tall
Rest forearms on thighs or desk with light contact.
Feel support below the elbows and length above the waist at the same time.
Balanced, not rigid.
Tap Continue.
Step 8 — Wrap up
One clean breath in through the nose… a longer, steady breath out through the mouth.
Calm body, awake mind.
Reset complete.

🔵 RESET 2 — Blink & Track (switching the eyes back on)
Duration: ~90–120 s • Why it helps: Blink bursts + smooth eye travel wake the visual system and sharpen focus.
Step 1 — Set the screen
Hold the phone about arm’s length away.
Keep your head fairly still; we’ll let the eyes do the travelling.
Shoulders loose, face soft.
Tap Continue.
Step 2 — Freshen the eyes
Fixate on a small spot in the centre of the screen.
Blink 5–7 quick times.
Your vision should feel a touch brighter and less gritty.
Tap Continue.
Step 3 — Left and right
Jump your gaze to the far left edge, then the far right edge.
Pause a heartbeat each side.
One rep is 4 gaze jumps
Left, right, left right 
Pause for a second after every 4th gaze jump
Complete 5-10 sets of gaze jumps 
Notice as your heart rate and breath increase with the rapid eye movement
You’re slowly starting to wake up your nervous system
Tap Continue.
Step 4 — Up and down
Eyes to the top edge, then the bottom edge.
Same small pause.
Do four cycles again following the pattern on the previous page
Pause for a second after every 4th gaze jump
Complete 5-10 sets of gaze jumps 
Your focus sharpens without strain.
Tap Continue.
Step 5 — Diagonals
Now we’re going from top-left → bottom-right… then top-right → bottom-left.
Pause for a second after every 4th gaze jump
Complete 5-10 sets of gaze jumps 
Jaw stays loose; shoulders easy; head quiet.
Tap Continue.
Step 6 — Soft circles
Trace a large, slow circle once clockwise, once anticlockwise.
Make it silky, not jerky.
Do this 5 times
If eyes feel dry, add one soft blink and rejoin.
Once done, Tap Continue.
Step 7 — Hold the centre
Return to the centre point.
Let the edges of your vision soften while the centre stays crisp.
Small inhale… longer exhale. Feel clarity arrive.
Once done, Tap Continue.
Step 8 — Wrap up
Notice the extra brightness in your view and the lift behind your eyes.
Time to get at it, carry this alertness into your next task .
Reset complete.

🔵 RESET 3 — Circulation Primer (a quick warm-through)
Duration: ~90–120 s • Why it helps: Small rhythmic movement boosts blood flow and alertness without a jolt.
Step 1 — Arrive
Sit or stand with a bit of space.
We’ll use small, joint-friendly movements.
If anything isn’t comfortable, ease or skip it.
Read each page, complete the exercise, then Tap Continue.
Step 2 — Wake the calves
Standing: lift both heels off the ground then lower, 10–12 easy reps.
Seated: alternate toe-presses into the ground into  toe lifts, again 10-12 easy reps.
Feel warmth move up the shins; breathing stays steady.
Tap Continue.
Step 3 — Wake the hands
Circle both wrists five times each way.
Then give the hands a light shake for a second or two.
Tingling in fingers = blood flow returning.
Once done, Tap Continue.
Step 4 — Open the shoulders
Elbows tucked by your sides, palms forward.
Rotate forearms so palms face the sky; pause; return to palms facing the floor
Do three slow reps. Chest opens; neck stays long.
Once done, Tap Continue.
Step 5 — Gentle spine wave
On a soft inhale, lift the breastbone a few millimetres.
On the exhale, ease back to neutral.
Do three smooth waves — no crunching or slumping.
Once done, Tap Continue.
Step 6 — Light rhythm
Standing: small march on the spot 15–20 seconds.
Seated: brisk heel taps or alternate knee lifts.
Let breath find the beat; keep shoulders relaxed.
Tap Continue.
Step 7 — Come back taller
Return to stillness a touch taller than when you began.
Notice a quiet hum in the body rather than heaviness.
Tap Continue.
Step 8 — Wrap up
Breathe In through the nose; out a fraction longer through the mouth.
Warm, switched on, ready.
Reset complete.
Safety note (small): ease or skip any move that’s uncomfortable.

🔵 RESET 4 — Sensory Switchboard (wake the senses, not just the brain)
Duration: ~90–120 s • Why it helps: Gentle touch + sound layering engages multiple sensory networks to lift alertness smoothly.
Step 1 — Start here
We’ll wake touch and sound so your system switches on without a jolt.
Keep your grip on the phone relaxed.
Read each page, complete the exercise, then Tap Continue.
Step 2 — Heat in the hands
Rub your palms together for 5–7 seconds.
Pause and notice the heat spreading into fingers and thumbs.
That warmth is your “on” signal.
Tap Continue.
Step 3 — Freshen the face
With warm hands, lightly press the palms of your hands on your cheeks → temples → scalp once.
Repeat this 5 times 
Lift the skin rather than dragging it.
Tap Continue.
Step 4 — Switch on the ears
Run thumb and finger up the outer ear edge from lobe of your ears to the tops on both sides,
then a tiny upward tug.
Then run your fingers back down to your lobes
Repeat this 5 times 
This adds an unnatural movement that awakens the mind.
Tap Continue.
Step 5 — Brush the forearms
Brush one forearm from wrist to elbow three slow passes, then swap.
Notice the skin sensation and the temperature changes of your skin
Do this 3 times on each arm
Tap Continue.
Step 6 — Sort the sound
Pick out a sound that is far away, notice it, identify it and stay with it for 5 seconds 
Then pick out a near sound (even your breath), notice this, identify it and stay with it for 5 seconds 
Then try to notice your stillness for 5 seconds
Tap Continue.
Step 7 — Snap the focus
Choose a tiny detail on the screen — a letter, an icon corner.
Hold it clearly for three seconds, then soften your gaze.
Feel attention sharpen without strain.
Tap Continue.
Step 8 — Wrap up
Sit or stand a touch taller.
Short clean inhale; longer steady exhale.
Senses on; mind clear.
Reset complete.

Scattered resets
🟢 Reset 1 — Focus Funnel
(Attentional narrowing: wide → medium → narrow focus to reduce mental scatter)
Step 1 — Settle in
Hold your phone in a relaxed grip. Feet planted. We’ll bring the mind from “everywhere” to “just here”.
Step 2 — Wide view
Look at the whole screen and a little beyond it. Let your eyes notice edges, colours, and space around you.
Step 3 — Medium view
Now let your gaze rest on the upper half of the screen only. Fewer things. A touch quieter.
Step 4 — Narrow view
Bring attention to one area the size of a coaster. Stay there for a slow breath in… and a longer breath out.
Step 5 — Single point
Choose one small point (icon corner, single letter). Keep a soft, steady gaze. Jaw loose. Shoulders easy.
Step 6 — Lock the lane
Quietly say in your head: “Just this.” Hold for one more breath. Let the rest fade to the edges.
Step 7 — Tiny action rehearsal
Picture the very first tap or click you’ll make after this screen. See your thumb do it smoothly.
Step 8 — Finish
From wide to one point. Take a clean out-breath. You’re centred again.

🟢 Reset 2 — Finger Ladder
(Motor sequencing + bilateral rhythm to stabilise attention)
Step 1 — Start
Rest elbows or forearms lightly. We’ll use a simple finger pattern to give your brain one clear track.
Step 2 — Left hand pattern
Tap thumb to index–middle–ring–little, then back to ring–middle–index. Slow and smooth.
Step 3 — Right hand pattern
Same on the right: index–middle–ring–little… and back. Keep the pace gentle; no rush.
Step 4 — Together, alternating
Left does the pattern once, then right does it once. Swap sides for two cycles. Breathe naturally.
Step 5 — Together, mirrored
Both hands now, but mirrored (thumb to index at the same time, then middle, etc.). One clean run up… and back.
Step 6 — Slow the tempo
Do the mirrored run again, but a notch slower. Feel the mind match the steadier rhythm.
Step 7 — Stillness check
Rest your hands. Notice how quiet the head feels when the sequence stops.
Step 8 — Finish
One short in-breath, one longer out-breath. Rhythm found, focus back. Reset complete.
Skip or ease any movement that isn’t comfortable for you.

🟢 Reset 3 — Grid Focus Drill
(Visuospatial working-memory; eyes-only tracking to tame “attention hopping”)
Step 1 — Set the scene
Imagine a simple 3×3 grid on your screen. Nine squares, like a noughts-and-crosses board.
Step 2 — Row scan
With only your eyes, trace the top row left-to-right… then the middle row… then the bottom row. Smooth and slow.
Step 3 — Column scan
Now trace the first column top-to-bottom… then the middle… then the last. Keep breathing easily.
Step 4 — Corners
Touch your gaze to each corner of the grid, clockwise. One full lap.
Step 5 — Centre
Settle your gaze on the centre square for one slow breath. Let everything else soften.
Step 6 — Short sequence
Follow this eyes-only path: top-middle → centre → bottom-middle → centre. Do it twice, unhurried.
Step 7 — Single square
Back to the centre square. Hold gently there for a longer out-breath.
Step 8 — Finish
The grid stays in your mind; noise drops. You’re steady enough to start the next thing.

🟢 Reset 4 — Single-Channel Mode
(One sensory “channel” at a time to stop multi-task drift)
Step 1 — Start
Scattered often means too many channels at once. We’ll run one channel at a time.
Step 2 — Eyes channel (10–15s)
Choose the eyes: look at a single spot on the screen. Notice only shape, brightness, edges. Nothing else.
Step 3 — Hands channel (10–15s)
Switch to hands: feel the phone’s weight, the skin on your fingertips, the tiny warmth where you’re holding it.
Step 4 — Ears channel (10–15s)
Switch to ears: pick one far sound, then one near sound (even your breath). Let the rest be background.
Step 5 — Back to eyes (short)
Return to the same spot on the screen. It’s easier to hold now.
Step 6 — Back to hands (short)
Feel the grip again; loosen it 5%. Shoulders soften.
Step 7 — Choose your working channel
Pick the channel you want to lead the next minute (eyes for reading, hands for doing, ears for listening). Say it in your head: “Eyes,” “Hands,” or “Ears.”
Step 8 — Finish
One channel, one lane. Slow out-breath. Take that into your next action.


GetReset — Tile-by-Tile Reset Player (Use Existing Design System)
Non-Negotiables
Do not change any existing design. Reuse all current tokens, colours, gradients, typography, spacing, shadows, icons, and button styles exactly as they are today.
Keep the existing emotion colours/gradients for Stressed, Anxious, Restless, Tired, Scattered, and Energy to Burn. Do not introduce new palettes.
Fit into the current card layout. The Reset Player should look like it has always been part of the app.

What to Build
Add a Reset Player that shows one step (“tile”) at a time.
Users move forward/back themselves with Continue / Back. No auto-advance.
Behaviour
Manual navigation only:
Primary button = Continue (keep existing primary style/gradient).
Secondary button = Back (keep existing ghost/secondary style).
Back is disabled on the first tile.
Optional Exit uses the existing close pattern (same icon/placement as other flows).
One step per tile: Each tile shows a Title and Body (multiple short lines).
Users must read the text clearly and then click Continue to proceed.
Keyboard: Enter/→ = Continue, ← = Back (if enabled).
No timers. No auto-advance. Pacing is user-controlled.
Progress: Use the current step dots/“Step X of Y” component already used in the app (same size/colour rules). Active dot uses the existing emotion accent.

Where It Lives
The Reset Player opens from the existing emotion tiles on the dashboard.
Keep the current route structure and page shells. Add a route/screen that renders the player inside the existing card container.
The list/grid of resets for an emotion should keep the current look; tapping a reset opens the player.

Data Model (use or mirror current content schema)
Add a lightweight spec the CMS/code can feed. Do not change global types already in use; extend locally if needed.
export type Emotion =
  | "stressed"
  | "anxious"
  | "restless"
  | "tired"
  | "scattered"
  | "energy";

export interface ResetStep {
  id: string;            // "step-1"
  title: string;         // "Settle in"
  lines: string[];       // each line renders as its own short paragraph
  animationKey?: string; // optional hint for existing micro-animations
  helperHint?: string;   // small grey helper text (optional)
}

export interface ResetSpec {
  id: string;                // "focus-funnel"
  emotion: Emotion;          // for theming; use existing colour tokens only
  name: string;              // "Focus Funnel"
  durationHintSeconds?: number;
  steps: ResetStep[];
  safetyNote?: string;       // small footer line when required
}

You will receive multiple ResetSpec objects separately; do not hard-code copy here.

Components (reuse styles)
ResetPlayer (new): receives a ResetSpec.
Renders: existing header pattern (icon, title, Exit), StepCard, existing progress component, and existing primary/secondary buttons.
StepCard (new logic, existing styles):
Layout = current card surface (rounded corners, shadow, padding).
Title uses the existing “step title” style.
Lines render as separate paragraphs (use existing body text tokens).
If lines overflow on small phones, enable vertical scroll with the app’s existing scroll fade.
Micro-animations (optional): If animationKey is present, show the existing small visuals (focus dot, sound bands, spine line, trays), respecting the app’s reduced-motion preference. Use current easing and durations.

Theming (strictly reuse)
Theme by emotion using current tokens only.
Keep the exact gradients/colours for icons, active dots, and the primary button — no new colours.
Backgrounds remain the app’s existing subtle gradients. No changes.

Navigation & State
Local state: currentIndex for step position.
Back/Continue clamp to bounds; Finish on last tile.
Optional: persist progress in local storage under reset/{id} so users can resume.
Optional analytics (if already present): fire reset_view, reset_step_next, reset_complete with reset_id, step_index.

Accessibility
Keep existing font sizes; ensure body text is ≥16px and high contrast.
Screen readers: announce Title, then each line; announce “Step X of Y”.
Honour reduced motion (turn off animations and transitions).
Buttons: maintain current hit-area sizes and focus outlines.

Acceptance Criteria
 The player renders inside existing cards with zero visual regressions.
 Users manually navigate with Continue/Back (and keyboard) — no auto-advance anywhere.
 Each tile shows all text clearly before proceeding.
 Progress reflects the current step using the existing dots/label.
 Emotion theming uses the app’s current tokens only.
 Optional animations appear only when animationKey is set and never obscure text.
 Works on current breakpoints (phone → desktop) exactly like the rest of the app.

Minimal Integration Sketch (respect existing components)
// Pseudocode: wire new logic into existing design system
function ResetPlayer({ reset }: { reset: ResetSpec }) {
  const [i, setI] = useState(0);
  const step = reset.steps[i];
  const atStart = i === 0;
  const atEnd = i === reset.steps.length - 1;

  return (
    <PageShell /* existing */>
      <Card /* existing card styles */>
        <Header /* existing */ icon={<EmotionIcon emotion={reset.emotion} />}>
          <Title>{reset.name}</Title>
          <ExitButton />
        </Header>

        <Progress /* existing */ current={i} total={reset.steps.length} emotion={reset.emotion} />

        <StepTitle>{step.title}</StepTitle>
        <StepBody>
          {step.lines.map((t, idx) => (<p key={idx}>{t}</p>))}
        </StepBody>

        {step.animationKey && <MicroAnimation keyName={step.animationKey} emotion={reset.emotion} />}

        {reset.safetyNote && <SafetyNote>{reset.safetyNote}</SafetyNote>}

        <FooterNav>
          <Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => setI(Math.max(0, i - 1))} disabled={atStart}>Back</Button>
          <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => setI(Math.min(reset.steps.length - 1, i + 1))}>
            {atEnd ? "Finish" : "Continue"}
          </Button>
        </FooterNav>
      </Card>
    </PageShell>
  );
}


Final reminders
Keep the current look and colours exactly as they are.
No auto-advance. Users choose to move forward/back by tapping Continue/Back.
Each tile must display the full text clearly before the user continues.

Remove any other emotions for now, just include the resets I have included above in a tile by tile format, there is a bubble popping game in the anxiety section already and this can stay the same, please don’t edit or change this
